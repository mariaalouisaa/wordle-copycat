# wordle-copycat

Take home challenge, inspired by the latest craze: [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)! The task given is to create a feature of the game Wordle.

**I have enjoyed this so much that I have contined to attempt a FULL copycat of the Wordle game.**

## User Journey

1. Use your keyboard or the buttons on the screen to guess a five letter word
2. Correct letters in the wrong place display yellow, right letter right place display green, wrong letter displays grey.
3. Keep guessing until you get the right word! (Beware you only get 6 tries!)
4. You can view you stats or the instructions at anytime, just click the buttons to make them pop-up.

## Code Features 

- Hidden pop-up messagaes that showcase CSS animation when changing between hidden and visible
- Lightmode / darkmode toggle
- Option for user to play with keyboard or buttons on the screen
- JavaScript .Date() Objects and setInterval() to display a countdown until next game
- navigator.clipboard.writeText() and setTimeout() to copy text to clipboard and display confirmation
- Progress bars to display the percentage of wins
- Responsive design
- DOM manipulation
- Stats saves to localStorage()
- GET requests made to [WordAPI](https://developer.wordnik.com/) to fetch random word on every page load!

## Still to do...

- Visual feedback to a user if a word entered is not a word
- Testing & code refactor

üëÄ I have plans to create a simular game, with a different theme, and using React to do so!
