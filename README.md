# wordle-copycat

Take home project for Founders & Coders, inspired by the lastest craze: Wordle!
The task is to complete an issue in this repo, which I have created based one what the user story would be for Wordle.

I have chosen to tackle Issue #1 to create the instructions. They appear on load, ontop of all other elements on the page, and can be closed and reopened.

Coded and maintained entirely my myself. Based of [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)
