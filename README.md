# wordle-copycat

Take home challenge for [Limio](limio.com), inspired by the lastest craze: [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)!

The task given is to complete an issue in this repo, which I have created based one what the user stories would be for Wordle.

I have chosen to tackle Issue #1 to create the instructions. They appear on load, ontop of all other elements on the page, and can be closed and reopened.

I have used:
- Semeantic HTML
- CSS variables
- onClick functions & DOM manipulation

I have also decided to tackle Issue #6 to create the statistics pop-up. This element too can be opened and closed.
An addition to the same features in the instructions pop-up I also have used:
- JavaScript .Date() Objects and setInterval() to display a countdown
- navigator.clipboard.writeText() and setTimeout() to copy text to clipbard and display confirmation
- Progress bars to display the percentage of wins
