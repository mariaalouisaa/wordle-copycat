# wordle-copycat

Take home challenge for [Limio](limio.com), inspired by the latest craze: [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)!

The task given is to create a feature of the game Wordle.
The issues in this repo are different user stories/features of the product to be made.

I have chosen to tackle Issue #1 to create the instructions. They appear on load, on top of all other elements on the page, and can be closed and reopened.

I have used:
- Semantic HTML
- CSS variables
- onclick functions & DOM manipulation

I have also decided to tackle Issue #6 to create the statistics pop-up. This element too can be opened and closed.
An addition to the same features in the instructions pop-up I also have used:
- JavaScript .Date() Objects and setInterval() to display a countdown
- navigator.clipboard.writeText() and setTimeout() to copy text to clipboard and display confirmation
- Progress bars to display the percentage of wins

*Please see issue #6 for comments on what still needs to be implemented on the statistics*

**I enjoyed this so much that I am planning to attempt a FULL copycat of the Wordle game.**

Coded and maintained entirely my myself. Design a mimic of [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).
